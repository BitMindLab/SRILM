Version History

0.90	29 Jun 95	first working code, n-gram models only

0.91	02 Aug 95	snapshot for fosler@icsi, minor bug fixes

0.92	13 Aug 95	added BayesMix, VarNgram LMs

0.93	27 Aug 95	included all LM95 code

0.94	13 Oct 95
	* new directory structure mirroring DECIPHER layout.
	* man pages added
	* added support for Decipher N-best list rescoring
	* added Null LM
	* added new utility scripts
	* bug fixes

0.95	08 Sep 96	as of WS96
	* added Trellis class, disambig program
	* added support for pause tokens (-pau-) in sentences
	  (these are ignored for sentence prob computation)
	* added -tolower mapping
	* added word reversal
	* made Ngram model reading much faster (optimized floating point parsing)
	* added template class for ngram count tries (to use either integer or
	  float count value)
	* added optional noise tag skipping
	* added SkipNgram model
	* added Witten-Bell backoff
	* ported to native Sun and SGI C++ compilers (see doc/c++porting-notes),
	* suppress log10(0.0) warnings

0.96	05 Jun 97
	* Honor -gtNmin parameter even when discounting of higher counts
	  is effectively disabled.  (Allows building maximum likelihood LMs
	  smoothed only by low-count ngram elimination.)
	* Ignore pauses and noise in nbest-lattice alignments (also added 
	  -noise option).
	* ngram now supports mixtures of up to 6 ngram models.
	* added HiddenSNgram LM.
	* warn about multiple uses of '-' file for input or output
	* zio now handles incomplete reading of compressed file without error
	* Fixed interaction between deletion and iterations
	* Fixed handling of OOVs in cache model
	* Fixed decipher nbest rescoring: we now duplicate even the 
	  roundoff errors incurred by bytelogs.  Also added -decipher flag
	  to ngram to allow replication of recognizer LM scores.
	  Also, takes into account that Decipher (incorrectly) applies WTW
	  even to pauses.
	* Enhanced decipher-rescore script to deal with NBestList2.0 format,
	  with -bytelog and -nodecipherlm options .
	* Added tools to convert bigram and trigram backoff LMs into 
	  Decipher PFSG format (pfsg-from-ngram).
	* Enable DecipherNgram models order higher than bigram
	  (ngram -decipher-order flag).  Default is still bigram.
	* Fixed bug that caused float command line arguments to be parsed
	  incorrectly on SunOS4 systems (missing declaration in system header).

0.97 	30 Aug 97	as of WS97
	* New programs: segment and segment-nbest (moved here from
	  development code).
	* Made low-level NgramLM access functions public
	  (findProb, findBOW, insertProb, insertBOW).
	* Fixed nbest-lattice to use normalized posterior word
	  probabilities in lattice.
	* NBest, nbest-lattice: added N-best error computation.
	* WordLattice, nbest-lattice: added lattice error computation.
	* WordLattice: base all alignments on edit distance costs defined
	  in WordAlign.h.
	* contextID() now also returns length of context used.
	  Added contextID() implementations for NullLM and BayesMix.
	* Fixed contextID() for Ngram: don't truncate context if BOW = 1.
	* Fixed SArray, LHash to avoid assignment operator on remove().
	* Fixed add-ppls, subtract-ppls to handle -ppl -debug 2 output.
	* Lots of memory management fixes.
	* SArrayIter and LHashIter now work even while underlying object is
	  being moved (as when containing data structure is enlarged).
	* Added HTK Lattice tool interface (htk/ directory).
	* Made Trellis into a template class.
	* Allow arbitrary n-gram orders with disambig(1).
	* Added forward-backward decoding and posterior probability computation
	  to disambig(1).
	* Added disambig -lmw and -mapw options.
	* Added HMMofNGrams model (ngram -hmm option).
	* VocabMap reader now warns about duplicate entries

0.98	18 April 98
	* Allow ngram to disable Decipher LM backoff hack, for rescoring
	  new exact lattices (ngram -decipher-nobackoff).
	* N-best list vocabulary is now always expanded dynamically
	  (no more OOVs in N-best lists).
	* Added wrapper script for nbest-lattice to compute nbest error rate
	  (nbest-error).
	* Skip ngrams exceeding model order when reading.
	* Fixed memory bug in generateSentence().
	* Changed libmisc to work with Tcl version > 7.
	* Compute word error correctly for empty nbest list.
	* Added ngram pruning based on model perplexity change
	  (ngram-count -prune and ngram -prune).
	* Old ngram -prune option renamed -varprune.
	* New lattice word error minimization (nbest-lattice -lattice-wer).
	* Fixed ngram -gen bug due to omissions in SunOS4 header files.
	* merge-batch-counts removes merged source files
	* Added ngram -prune-lowprobs function to do the work of
	  remove-lowprob-ngrams, but much faster and using less memory.
	* Added support for new Decipher NBestList2.0 format.
	* Added word error count and posterior probability fields to NBestHyp
	  structure.
	* Added optional factor argument to countSentence() (convenient
	  to compute fractional sufficient statistics for alternative
	  training methods).
	* Don't make special symbols (<s>, </s>, <unk>) member of SubVocab
	  by default.
	* Ported to gcc 2.8.1 .

0.99	31 July 1999
	* Added hidden-ngram (word-boundary tagger).
	* Removed line length limit for File object.
	* Added disambig -continuous flag.
	* Fixed backward computation in disambig (again).
	* Generalized compute-best-mix to N > 2 models
	* Added AdaptiveMix LM class
	* Added nbest-mix utility (interpolation of nbest posteriors)
	* Added ngram -unk flag to handle open-class LMs
	* Added disambig and hidden-ngram -text-map option
	* Script enhancements:
	  - New script to convert nbest-lattice word graphs to PFSG
	    (wlat-to-pfsg)
	  - Added switches include probabilities in wlat-to-dot and pfsg-to-dot
	    output.
	  - Conversion to/from AT&T FSM format: fsm-to-pfsg and pfsg-to-fsm
	* ngram -rescore and associated scripts no longer set a hyp 
	   probability to zero if it contains OOVs. Instead, the probability
	   is computed ignoring those words (more useful in practice).
	   A warning is output as always.
	* Added ngram-count -float-counts option.
	* Added build support for Linux/i686 platform.
