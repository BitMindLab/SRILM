	* new directory structure mirroring DECIPHER layout.
	* man pages added
	* added support for Decipher N-best list rescoring
	* added Null LM
	* added new utility scripts
	* bug fixes

0.95	08 Sep 96	as of WS96
	* added Trellis class, disambig program
	* added support for pause tokens (-pau-) in sentences
	  (these are ignored for sentence prob computation)
	* added -tolower mapping
	* added word reversal
	* made Ngram model reading much faster (optimized floating point parsing)

	* added SkipNgram model
	* added Witten-Bell backoff
	* ported to native Sun and SGI C++ compilers (see doc/c++porting-notes),
	* suppress log10(0.0) warnings

0.96	05 Jun 97
	* Honor -gtNmin parameter even when discounting of higher counts
	  is effectively disabled.  (Allows building maximum likelihood LMs
	  smoothed only by low-count ngram elimination.)

	  -noise option).
	* ngram now supports mixtures of up to 6 ngram models.
	* added HiddenSNgram LM.
	* warn about multiple uses of '-' file for input or output
	* zio now handles incomplete reading of compressed file without error
	* Fixed interaction between deletion and iterations
	* Fixed handling of OOVs in cache model
	* Fixed decipher nbest rescoring: we now duplicate even the 
	  roundoff errors incurred by bytelogs.  Also added -decipher flag
	  to ngram to allow replication of recognizer LM scores.
	  Also, takes into account that Decipher (incorrectly) applies WTW
	  even to pauses.

	  with -bytelog and -nodecipherlm options .
	* Added tools to convert bigram and trigram backoff LMs into 
	  Decipher PFSG format (pfsg-from-ngram).
	* Enable DecipherNgram models order higher than bigram
	  (ngram -decipher-order flag).  Default is still bigram.
	* Fixed bug that caused float command line arguments to be parsed
	  incorrectly on SunOS4 systems (missing declaration in system header).

0.97 	30 Aug 97	as of WS97
	* New programs: segment and segment-nbest (moved here from
	  development code).
	* Made low-level NgramLM access functions public
	  (findProb, findBOW, insertProb, insertBOW).

	  probabilities in lattice.
	* NBest, nbest-lattice: added N-best error computation.
	* WordLattice, nbest-lattice: added lattice error computation.
	* WordLattice: base all alignments on edit distance costs defined
	  in WordAlign.h.
	* contextID() now also returns length of context used.
	  Added contextID() implementations for NullLM and BayesMix.
	* Fixed contextID() for Ngram: don't truncate context if BOW = 1.
	* Fixed SArray, LHash to avoid assignment operator on remove().
	* Fixed add-ppls, subtract-ppls to handle -ppl -debug 2 output.
	* Lots of memory management fixes.
	* SArrayIter and LHashIter now work even while underlying object is
	  being moved (as when containing data structure is enlarged).
	* Added HTK Lattice tool interface (htk/ directory).
	* Made Trellis into a template class.
	* Allow arbitrary n-gram orders with disambig(1).
	* Added forward-backward decoding and posterior probability computation
	  to disambig(1).

	* Added HMMofNGrams model (ngram -hmm option).
	* VocabMap reader now warns about duplicate entries

0.98	18 April 98
	* Allow ngram to disable Decipher LM backoff hack, for rescoring
	  new exact lattices (ngram -decipher-nobackoff).
	* N-best list vocabulary is now always expanded dynamically
	  (no more OOVs in N-best lists).
	* Added wrapper script for nbest-lattice to compute nbest error rate
	  (nbest-error).
	* Skip ngrams exceeding model order when reading.
	* Fixed memory bug in generateSentence().
	* Changed libmisc to work with Tcl version > 7.
	* Compute word error correctly for empty nbest list.

	  (ngram-count -prune and ngram -prune).
	* Old ngram -prune option renamed -varprune.
	* New lattice word error minimization (nbest-lattice -lattice-wer).
	* Fixed ngram -gen bug due to omissions in SunOS4 header files.
	* merge-batch-counts removes merged source files
	* Added ngram -prune-lowprobs function to do the work of
	  remove-lowprob-ngrams, but much faster and using less memory.
	* Added support for new Decipher NBestList2.0 format.
	* Added word error count and posterior probability fields to NBestHyp
	  structure.
	* Added optional factor argument to countSentence() (convenient
	  to compute fractional sufficient statistics for alternative
	  training methods).
	* Don't make special symbols (<s>, </s>, <unk>) member of SubVocab
	  by default.
	* Ported to gcc 2.8.1 .

0.99	31 July 1999

	  - New script to convert nbest-lattice word graphs to PFSG
	    (wlat-to-pfsg)
	  - Added switches include probabilities in wlat-to-dot and pfsg-to-dot
	    output.
	  - Conversion to/from AT&T FSM format: fsm-to-pfsg and pfsg-to-fsm
	* ngram -rescore and associated scripts no longer set a hyp 
	   probability to zero if it contains OOVs. Instead, the probability
	   is computed ignoring those words (more useful in practice).
	   A warning is output as always.
	* Added ngram-count -float-counts option.
	* Added build support for Linux/i686 platform.

1.00 	8 June 2000

	* Capability to convert class ngrams into word ngrams.
	* New program ngram-class for automatic word class induction.
	* Fixed interaction of ngram -mix-lm -bayes with non-standard n-grams:
	  can now build an interpolation of the non-standard (hidden-event,
	  class-based, etc.) n-gram with the additional, standard n-grams.
	* Replaced LM.noiseTag with LM.noiseVocab (list of noise tags to
	  be ignored).  Tools now take -noise-vocab option (as well as -noise
	  for backward compatibility).
	* Made ngram -counts work for non-n-gram models.
	* Added nbest-lattice -posterior-{amw,lmw,wtw} options to compute

	  (defaulting to 1 as before).
	* New class RefList (list of reference transcripts).
	* New class NBestSet (set of N-Best lists).
	* NBest, NBestSet, and nbest-lattice optionally split multiwords into
	  their components on reading (-multiwords option).
	* New nbest-optimize tool for finding near-optimal score combination
	  weights for word error minimizing N-best rescoring.
	* New anti-ngram program, for computing posterior-weighted N-gram
	  counts from N-best lists.
	* New nbest-rover script allows ROVER-style combination of hypotheses
	  from multiple N-best lists.
	* New rescore-decipher -norescore option, to reformat N-best lists
	  without LM rescoring.
	* Fixed bugs related to missing <s> and </s> in change-lm-vocab and
	  make-ngram-pfsg.
	* Significant speedups in LMs involving dynamic programming
	  (HiddenNgram, DFNgram, HMMofNgrams) when interpolating with other 
	  models or running in "ngram -debug 2" mode.
	* Allow absolute discounting on fractional counts, for more
	  effective construction of models from fractional counts.
	* Added ngram-merge -float-counts option, and allow "-" (stdin) as
	  input file.
	* ngram-count ensures <s> unigram (with prob 0) is defined to avoid
	  breaking other programs.
	* Added make-abs-discount script to compute absolute discounting 
	  constants from Good-Turing statistics.
	* compute-sclite and compare-sclite now take -multiwords option to
	  split compound words prior to scoring.

	  to be non-negative.
	* Added Map2 (2D Map) class to libdstruct.
	* Much better string hash function (borrowed from Tcl).
	* New man pages: training-scripts(1), lm-scripts(1), ppl-scripts(1),
	  pfsg-scripts(1), nbest-scripts(1), lm-format(5), classes-format(5),
	  pfsg-format(5), nbest-format(5).

1.0.1	12 July 2000

	Functionality:

	* wordError() and nbest-lattice -dump-errors now also output the
	  location of deletions in the alignment (NOTE: possible code
	  incompatibility).
	* New reverse-ngram-counts script.

	Bug fixes:

	* Workarounds for shortcomings in Linux gcc, math library, and linker.
	* make-ngram-pfsg: don't ignore bigram states with zero BOW (bugfix).
