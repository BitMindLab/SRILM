#
#    Description:
#       This is the makefile for developing a new application
#       using the DECIPHER System.
#
#       To use this makefile:
#
#	   0). Make sure you have your SRILM environment variable
#		set correctly. 
#
#          1). Make a development directory (e.g. "~user/dev/src") and
#               then move to it:
#
#		  prompt% mkdir -p ~user/dev/src
#		  prompt% cd ~user/dev/src
#
#	   2). Copy this file to your development directory:
#
#		  prompt% cp $SRILM/common/Makefile.development Makefile
#
#	   3). Create the directories for object and binary files:
#
#	          prompt% gnumake init
#
#	   4). Update the list of libraries to reflect those needed to link
#	       your program.  If it comes from a module directory, use the
#	       module Makefile as a guide.  Note that order is important in
#	       this list.
#
#	   5). Build your application, using the released versions of the 
#	       SRILM libraries:
#
#	       - Create your application "main()" file, e.g. "app-main.cc".
#              - Replace the line "PROGRAM_NAMES = none" with
#                "PROGRAM_NAMES = app-main" to "Makefile".  (Note:
#                You can have multiple programs defined here, as long
#                as each one has a single file, named "<ProgramName>.cc"
#                which provides its "main()" function.)
#              - Build your application with "gnumake".
#
#          6). To replace the released versions of files in the SRILM
#              libraries with your own modified versions, copy the
#              files to your development directory and then add each
#              new source file to the "REPLACEMENT_SOURCES" definition.
#              Do a  "gnumake depend" on each type of machine, and then 
#	       remake your application with "gnumake".
#
#          7). (Optional) After you have debugged your modifications, have
#	       them merged into the main SRILM System in "$SRILM".
