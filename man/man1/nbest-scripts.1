.SH DESCRIPTION
These scripts perform common tasks on N-best hypotheses in 
.BR nbest-format (5),
especially those needed for rescoring and extracting and evaluating
1-best hypotheses.
.PP
.B rescore-decipher
applies a language model implemented by 
.BR ngram (1)
to the N-best lists listed in
.IR nbest-file-list .
The N-best files may be in compressed format.
The rescored N-best lists are stored in directory
.IR score-dir .
All following arguments are passed to 
.BR ngram (1)
and are used to control the language model.
The
.B \-bytelog 
option causes scores to be output on the bytelog scale
(see 
.BR nbest-format (1)).
.B \-nodecipherlm
indicates that the recognizer language model is not being provided
(with
.BR \-decipher-lm ).
(This is only possible if the N-best lists are not in ``NBestList1.0'' format.)
.BR \-multiwords
specifies that N-best lists contain words joined by underscores, which are
to be split into their component prior to rescoring.
.BR \-norescore
causes N-best lists to be simply reformatted from one of the Decipher formats
into the SRILM N-best format, separating acoustic and LM scores, without
replacing the existing LM scores.
In this case only the 
.BR ngram (1)
options
.BR \-decipher-lmw
and 
.BR \-decipher-wtw
are relevant, and others are ignored.
.PP
.B rescore-acoustic
replaces the acoustic scores in a set of N-best lists by a weighted 
combination of new scores.
The old N-best lists are given by either a directory
.I old-score-dir
or a filelist
.IR old-file-list ;
.I old-ac-weight
is the weight given to the old scores.
Directories containing the new scores are listed alternating with the
corresponding weights; each score directory must contain one 
file per waveform segment, each having the same file basenames as 
the original N-best lists.
The new scores should appear in a single column per file, one per line.
The N-best lists containing the new combined acoustic scores are written to 
.IR new-nbest-dir .
The optional
.I max-nbest
argument can be used to limit the length of the N-best lists output.
Also, When a new score file is encountered containing fewer than
.I max-nbest
lines, the missing scores are set to the lowest score encountered so far.
.PP
.B rescore-reweight
combines the scores in N-best lists with a set of weights and outputs
the 1-best hypotheses.
The N-best files are found in directory
.I score-dir
or listed in
.IR file-list .
They must have been produced with a prior run of
.BR rescore-decipher .
Optional arguments set the language model weight
.I lmw
(default 8),
the word transition weight
.I wtw
(default 0),
and the maximum number
.I max-nbest
of hypotheses to consider (default all).
.B \-multiwords
indicates that multi-words are to be split into their components.
The output format for 1-best hypotheses is
.br
	\fIsentid\fP \fIw1\fP \fIw2\fP ...
.br
where
.I sentid
is the sentence ID derived from the N-best filename, followed by 
the words.
.PP
.B rescore-minimize-wer
is similar to 
.B rescore-reweight
but picks hypotheses using the word error minimization algorithm
of 
.BR nbest-lattice (1).
.PP
.B nbest2-to-nbest1
converts an N-best list in ``NBestList2.0'' format to ``NBestlist1.0'',
for the benefit of programs that have not yet been updated to deal with 
the new format.
.PP
.B nbest-rover
combines hypotheses from multiple N-best lists at the word level,
by performing the same kind of word error minimization as 
.BR nbest-lattice (1),
in a generalization of the ROVER algorithm.
.I sentid-list
is a file listing sentence IDs.
These must match the filenames in a set of N-best directories,
which are specified in a
.IR control-file .
The format for the latter is
.br
	\fIdir1\fP \fIlmw1\fP \fIwtw1\fP \fIw1\fP [\fIn1\fP [\fIs1\fP]]
.br
	\fIdir2\fP \fIlmw2\fP \fIwtw2\fP \fIw2\fP [\fIn2\fP \fIs2\fP]]
.br
	...
.br
Each line specifies an N-best directory, the language model and word transition
weights to be used in score combination, and a weight to be applied to the
posterior probabilities.
An optional next-to-last parameter for each N-best list allows the lists to be 
truncated to the top \fIn1\fP, \fIn2\fP, etc., hypotheses.
The final optional parameter sets the posterior distribution scaling factor,
which defaults to the language model weight.
Optionally,
.I control-file
can also contain lines of the form
.br
	\fIdir\fP \fIw\fP \fB+\fP
.br
These indicate that additional score files can be found in directory
.I dir
and that the scores found therein should be added to the following 
N-best list set with weight
.IR w .
Several lines of this form may occur preceding a regular N-best
directory specification; the corresponding additive combination of multiple
scores is performed.
.br
If ``\-'' is specified for
.IR sentid-list ,
the sentence IDs are inferred from
the contents of the first directory \fIdir1\fP specified in
.IR control-file .
If
.I posterior-file
is specified on the command line, posterior word probability estimates are
written to that file.
Any additional arguments are passed as options to the underlying
.BR nbest-lattice (1)
invocation.
.PP
.B nbest-posteriors
rescales the scores in an N-best list to reflect (weighted) posterior
probabilities.
The input
.I nbest-file
must be in rescored SRILM N-best format.
The output is the same N-best list with acoustic scores set to
the log (base 10) of the posterior hyp probabilities and LM scores set to zero.
.BI postscale= S
attenuates the posterior distribution by dividing combined log 
scores by
.I S
(the default is
.IR S = lmw ).
If
.BI weight= W
is specified the posteriors are multiplied by
.IR W .
.BI max_nbest= M
limits the number of hypotheses used to the top 
.IR M .
This script is used mostly as a helper in
.BR nbest-rover .
.PP
.B nbest-error
computes the overall oracle word error rate of a set of N-best lists
in directory
.I score-dir
or listed in
.IR file-list .
The reference answers are given in
.I refs 
in the format output by 
.B rescore-reweight 
(see above).
The optional
.I max-nbest
controls the length of N-best lists considered.
.PP
.B sentid-to-sclite
converts 1-best hypotheses and references in the format used here to
the ``trn'' format expected by the NIST
.BR sclite (1)
scoring software.
.PP
.B compute-sclite
is a wrapper around 
.BR sclite (1).
.I refs
and
.I hyps 
are the reference and hypothesized transcripts, respectively. 
Optionally, 
.I subset 
specifies a sorted list of sentence IDs to score.
Any additional options are passed to
.BR sclite ,
e.g., to control its output actions or alignment mode.
.B \-multiwords 
or
.B \-M
splits ``multiwords'' joined by underscores into their component words
prior to scoring.
.B \-v 
displays the complete command used to invoke
.BR sclite .
.PP
.B compare-sclite
scores two sets of hypotheses 
.I hyps1
and
.I hyps2
for the same test set and computes in
how many cases the first or second set had lower word error.
The remaining options are as for
.BR compute-sclite .
The script ignores hypotheses for sentence that do not appear in both
hypothesis files, to ensure comparable scoring results.
