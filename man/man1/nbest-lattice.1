.SH NAME
nbest-lattice \- rescore N-best lists and lattices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nbest-lattice
[\c
.BR \-help ]
option
\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nbest-lattice
rescores N-best lists or optimizes word-level recognition scores
(as opposed to sentence-level scores).
There are two rescoring modes.
In
.I "N-best word error minimization"
mode, the program computes the posterior expected word error for each
hypothesis relative to all hypotheses in the N-best list, choosing the one
with the lowest value.
.PP
In
.I  "lattice word error minimization"
mode, the program constructs a word lattice from all the N-best hypotheses
and extracts the path with the lowest expected word error.
This is similar to N-best word error minimization but allows 
hypotheses not contained in the N-best list.
A variant of this mode uses a word ``mesh'' instead of a word lattice,
in which all hypotheses are aligned into a grid of word positions,
and one is allowed to chose a word from each grid position, thus allowing an
even greater number of potential hypotheses.
.PP
Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a 
compressed file (name ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate
stdin/stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-help
Print option summary.
.TP
.BI \-debug " level"
Controls the amount of output (the higher the
.IR level ,
the more).
At level 1, the expected word error counts for the chosen hypotheses
are printed.
At level 2, the word posterior probabilities are printed in addition
(only for lattice mode, similar to 
.BR \-dump-posteriors ).
.TP
.B \-wer
Chooses N-best word error minimization mode.
.TP
.B \-lattice\-wer
Chooses lattice word error minimization mode (the default).
.TP
.B \-use-mesh
Choose the variant of lattice mode that uses word meshes instead of
simple lattices.
.TP
.BI \-deletion-bias " D"
Causes the probabilities of deletions to be biased by a factor
.I D
in doing mesh-based word error minimization.
This controls the trade-off between insertion and deletion errors.
The default is 1 (no bias).
.TP
.BI \-rescore " file"
Reads the N-best list from
.IR file .
The N-best list can be in any of the formats described in
.BR nbest-format (5).
.TP
.BI \-nbest " file"
A synonym for 
.BR \-rescore .
.TP
.BI \-write-nbest " file"
Outputs the N-best list to a file, after sorting and processing 
(for validation purposes).
.TP
.BI \-nbest-files " file-list"
Rescores multiple N-best lists whose filenames are read from
.IR file-list .
.TP
.BI \-max-nbest " n"
Limits the number of hypotheses read from each N-best list to the first
.IR n .
.TP
.BI \-max-rescore " m"
Only choose among the top
.I m
hypotheses when optimizing word error.
This is convenient to limit computation for long N-best lists.
The cutoff is made after reading all hypotheses (subject to
.BR \-max-nbest )
and reordering them according to the posterior probabilities.
.br
The worst-case time taken in N-best error minimization is proportional to 
.I m
times
.IR n ,
where
.I n
is the length of the N-best list (or the value given to
.BR \-max-nbest ).
However, in practice the average time per sentence is independent of 
.IR m ,
so this option is usually not necessary.
.TP
.BI \-posterior-prune " threshold"
Don't process N-best hypotheses whose cumulative posterior probability
is below
.IR threshold .
This is another strategy to speed up the algorithm.
.TP
.B \-no-reorder
Process N-best hypotheses in the order in which they appear.
By default, hypotheses are first sorted by their aggregate scores.
.TP
.BI \-rescore-lmw " lmw"
Sets the language model weight used in combining the language model log
probabilities with acoustic log probabilities
(only relevant if separate scores are given in the N-best input).
.TP
.BI \-rescore-wtw " wtw"
Sets the word transition weight used to weight the number of words relative to
the acoustic log probabilities
(only relevant if separate scores are given in the N-best input).
.TP
.BI \-posterior-scale " scale"
Divide the total weighted log score by 
.I scale
when computing normalized posterior probabilities.
This controls the peakedness of the posterior distribution. 
The default value is whatever was chosen for 
.BR \-rescore-lmw , 
so that language model scores are scaled to have weight 1,
and acoustic scores have weight 1/\fIlmw\fP.
.TP
.BI \-posterior-amw " amw"
Sets the acoustic model weight for computing posteriors; 
the default is 1.
This and the next two options allow posteriors to be computed using a 
different weighting than that used in ranking and reordering the 
hypotheses.
.TP
.BI \-posterior-lmw " lmw"
Sets the language model weight for computing posteriors.
The default is to use whatever was specified for
.BR \-rescore-lmw .
.TP
.BI \-posterior-wtw " wtw"
Sets the word transition weight for computing posteriors.
The default is to use whatever was specified for
.BR \-rescore-wtw .
.TP
.BI \-vocab " file"
Read the N-best list vocabulary from 
.IR file .
This option is mostly redundant since words found in the N-best input
are implicitly added to the vocabulary.
.TP
.B \-tolower
Map vocabulary to lowercase, eliminating case distinctions.
.TP
.B \-multiwords
Split multiwords (words joined by '_') into their components when reading
N-best lists.
.TP
.BI \-noise " noise-tag"
Designate
.I noise-tag
as a vocabulary item that is to be ignored in aligning hypotheses with
each other (the same as the -pau- word).
This is typically used to identify a noise marker.
.TP
.BI \-noise-vocab " file"
Read several noise tags from
.IR file ,
instead of, or in addition to, the single noise tag specified by
.BR \-noise .
.TP
.BI \-nbest-errors " references"
Compute the N-best error (minimum word error) of the N-best list read with
.BR \-nbest .
Error is computed relative to all the hypotheses contained in a separate
N-best list given by
.IR references .
Pause and noise tokens (as specified with
.BR \-noise )
in the N-best list are ignored.
.TP
.B \-dump-posteriors
Output posterior probabilities of all N-best hypotheses 
instead of choosing the best hypothesis.
In N-best mode, only the posterior probability for each hypothesis is output.
In lattice mode, the hyp posterior is followed by word posterior probabilities
for each (non-pause, non-noise) token in the hypothesis.
The 
.B \-max-rescore
option limits the number of hypotheses per N-best list processed.
.TP
.B \-dump-errors
Output word correctness indicators for all N-best hypotheses 
instead of choosing the best hypothesis.
For each hypothesis, a line is output containing first the total number of 
errors and the list of indicators of whether the corresponding word is
correct, substituted or inserted relative to the reference string.
The location of deleted words is also indicated by a corresponding marker.
The 
.B \-max-rescore
option limits the number of hypotheses per N-best list processed.
.TP
.BI \-reference " w1 w2 ..."
Specifies a reference word string for 
.BR \-dump-errors .
.PP
The following options only affect lattice mode.
.TP
.BI \-read " file"
Reads an initial lattice from
.IR file ,
to be merged with additional paths constructed from the 
N-best hypotheses.
.TP
.BI \-write " file"
Writes the resulting N-best lattice to
.IR file .
.TP
.B \-prime-lattice
Start building the lattice with the best hypothesis obtained from
N-best error minimization.  This produces slightly better alignments
and sometimes lower error rates.  The default is to start with the
top-scoring hypothesis.
.TP
.B \-prime-with-1best
Similar to 
.BR \-prime-lattice ,
but uses the top-ranked sentence hypothesis for priming.
(Experience shows that 
.B  "\-no-reorder \-prime-lattice"
gives best results.)
.TP
.B \-no-merge
Build a lattice from the N-best hypotheses without merging edges
(string/lattice alignment).  This creates a lattice with one disjoint path
per hypothesis, and is useful mainly for debugging purposes.
.TP
.BI \-lattice-errors " references"
Compute the lattice error (minimum word error) of the lattice read with
.B \-read
or built with 
.BR \-nbest .
Error is computed relative to all the hypotheses contained in a separate
N-best list given by
.IR references .

.SH BUGS
Only a subset of functions is available when processing multiple
N-best lists.
.br
The options for word and lattice error computation are not consistent:
.B \-dump-errors 
takes the reference on the command line, whereas
.B \-lattice-errors 
and
.B \-nbest-errors
use a separate N-best list.
