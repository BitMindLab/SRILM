DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee  rescores  N-best  lists  or optimizes word-
       level recognition scores  (as  opposed  to  sentence-level
       scores).   There  are two rescoring modes.  In _N_-_b_e_s_t _w_o_r_d
       _e_r_r_o_r _m_i_n_i_m_i_z_a_t_i_o_n mode, the program computes  the  poste-
       rior  expected  word error for each hypothesis relative to
       all hypotheses in the N-best list, choosing the  one  with
       the lowest value.

       In  _l_a_t_t_i_c_e _w_o_r_d _e_r_r_o_r _m_i_n_i_m_i_z_a_t_i_o_n mode, the program con-
       structs a word lattice from all the N-best hypotheses  and
       extracts  the  path  with  the lowest expected word error.
       This is similar to  N-best  word  error  minimization  but
       allows  hypotheses  not  contained  in the N-best list.  A
       variant of this mode uses a word  ``mesh''  instead  of  a
       word  lattice,  in which all hypotheses are aligned into a
       grid of word positions, and one is allowed to chose a word
       from  each  grid  position,  thus allowing an even greater
       number of potential hypotheses.

       Each filename argument can be an ASCII  file,  or  a  com-
       pressed file (name ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indi-
       cate stdin/stdout.

       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --ddeebbuugg _l_e_v_e_l
              Controls the  amount  of  output  (the  higher  the
              _l_e_v_e_l,  the  more).   At level 1, the expected word
              error counts for the chosen hypotheses are printed.
              At  level  2,  the word posterior probabilities are
              printed in addition (only for lattice mode, similar
              to --dduummpp--ppoosstteerriioorrss).

       --wweerr   Chooses N-best word error minimization mode.

       --llaattttiiccee--wweerr
              Chooses  lattice  word error minimization mode (the
              default).

       --uussee--mmeesshh
              Choose the variant of lattice mode that  uses  word
              meshes instead of simple lattices.

       --ddeelleettiioonn--bbiiaass _D
              Causes  the probabilities of deletions to be biased
              by a factor _D in doing mesh-based word error  mini-
              mization.   This  controls  the  trade-off  between
              insertion and deletion errors.  The  default  is  1
              (no bias).

       --rreessccoorree _f_i_l_e
              Reads  the  N-best list from _f_i_l_e.  The N-best list
              can be in any of the formats  described  in  nnbbeesstt--
              ffoorrmmaatt(5).

       --nnbbeesstt _f_i_l_e
              A synonym for --rreessccoorree.

       --wwrriittee--nnbbeesstt _f_i_l_e
              Outputs  the  N-best  list to a file, after sorting
              and processing (for validation or format conversion
              purposes).

       --ddeecciipphheerr--nnbbeesstt
              Output  N-best  list  in  Decipher nnbbeesstt--ffoorrmmaatt(5),
              rather than the default native SRILM format.   (All
              N-best formats are accepted for input regardless of
              this option.)

       --nnoo--rreessccoorree
              Suppress rescoring of lattices; useful if only  the
              operations  of  lattice/N-best list reading/writing
              are desired.

       --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess _f_i_l_e_-_l_i_s_t
              Rescores multiple N-best lists whose filenames  are
              read from _f_i_l_e_-_l_i_s_t.

       --mmaaxx--nnbbeesstt _n
              Limits  the  number of hypotheses read from each N-
              best list to the first _n.

       --mmaaxx--rreessccoorree _m
              Only choose among the top _m hypotheses  when  opti-
              mizing  word  error.   This  is convenient to limit
              computation for long N-best lists.  The  cutoff  is
              made after reading all hypotheses (subject to --mmaaxx--
              nnbbeesstt) and reordering them according to the  poste-
              rior probabilities.
              The worst-case time taken in N-best error minimiza-
              tion is proportional to _m times _n, where _n  is  the
              length  of  the  N-best list (or the value given to
              --mmaaxx--nnbbeesstt).  However, in practice the average time
              per sentence is independent of _m, so this option is
              usually not necessary.

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--pprruunnee _t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d
              Don't process N-best  hypotheses  whose  cumulative
              posterior  probability is below _t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d.  This is
              another strategy to speed up the algorithm.

       --nnoo--rreeoorrddeerr
              Process N-best hypotheses in  the  order  in  which
              they  appear.   By  default,  hypotheses  are first
              sorted by their aggregate scores.

       --nnbbeesstt--bbaacckkttrraaccee
              Preserve    backtrace    information    (word-level
              timemarks  and  scores)  when  reading N-best lists
              containing such information (see  nnbbeesstt--ffoorrmmaatt(5)).
              The  default is to ignore backtrace information and
              record only  sentence-level  scores  and  the  word
              identities.

       --rreessccoorree--llmmww _l_m_w
              Sets  the  language  model weight used in combining
              the language model log probabilities with  acoustic
              log probabilities (only relevant if separate scores
              are given in the N-best input).

       --rreessccoorree--wwttww _w_t_w
              Sets the word transition weight used to weight  the
              number of words relative to the acoustic log proba-
              bilities (only  relevant  if  separate  scores  are
              given in the N-best input).

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--ssccaallee _s_c_a_l_e
              Divide  the  total weighted log score by _s_c_a_l_e when
              computing normalized posterior probabilities.  This
              controls  the peakedness of the posterior distribu-
              tion.  The default value is whatever was chosen for
              --rreessccoorree--llmmww,  so  that  language  model scores are
              scaled to have weight 1, and acoustic  scores  have
              weight 1/_l_m_w.

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--aammww _a_m_w
              Sets the acoustic model weight for computing poste-
              riors; the default is 1.  This  and  the  next  two
              options  allow  posteriors  to  be computed using a
              different weighting than that used in  ranking  and
              reordering the hypotheses.

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--llmmww _l_m_w
              Sets the language model weight for computing poste-
              riors.  The default is to use whatever  was  speci-
              fied for --rreessccoorree--llmmww.

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--wwttww _w_t_w
              Sets  the word transition weight for computing pos-
              teriors.  The default is to use whatever was speci-
              fied for --rreessccoorree--wwttww.

       --vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read  the  N-best  list vocabulary from _f_i_l_e.  This
              option is mostly redundant since words found in the
              N-best  input  are  implicitly added to the vocabu-
              lary.

       --ttoolloowweerr
              Map vocabulary to lowercase, eliminating case  dis-
              tinctions.

       --mmuullttiiwwoorrddss
              Split  multiwords  (words joined by '_') into their
              components when reading N-best lists.

       --nnooiissee _n_o_i_s_e_-_t_a_g
              Designate _n_o_i_s_e_-_t_a_g as a vocabulary item that is to
              be  ignored  in aligning hypotheses with each other
              (the same as the -pau- word).   This  is  typically
              used to identify a noise marker.

       --nnooiissee--vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read  several  noise tags from _f_i_l_e, instead of, or
              in addition to, the single noise tag  specified  by
              --nnooiissee.

       --kkeeeepp--nnooiissee
              Do  not  remove pause or noise tokens from hypothe-
              ses. The default is  to  preserve  noise  tags  but
              still eliminate pauses.

       --nnbbeesstt--eerrrroorr
              Compute  the  N-best  error (minimum word error) of
              the N-best list read with --nnbbeesstt.  Pause and  noise
              tokens  (as  specified  with  --nnooiissee) in the N-best
              list are ignored.

       --dduummpp--ppoosstteerriioorrss
              Output  posterior  probabilities  of   all   N-best
              hypotheses instead of choosing the best hypothesis.
              In N-best mode, only the posterior probability  for
              each  hypothesis  is  output.  In lattice mode, the
              hyp posterior is followed by word posterior  proba-
              bilities  for  each (non-pause, non-noise) token in
              the hypothesis.  The --mmaaxx--rreessccoorree option limits the
              number of hypotheses per N-best list processed.

       --dduummpp--eerrrroorrss
              Output  word  correctness indicators for all N-best
              hypotheses instead of choosing the best hypothesis.
              For  each  hypothesis,  a line is output containing
              first the total number of errors and  the  list  of
              indicators  of  whether  the  corresponding word is
              correct, substituted or inserted  relative  to  the
              reference string.  The location of deleted words is
              also indicated  by  a  corresponding  marker.   The
              --mmaaxx--rreessccoorree option limits the number of hypotheses
              per N-best list processed.

       --rreeffeerreennccee _w_1 _w_2 _._._.
              Specifies a reference word string for --dduummpp--eerrrroorrss,
              --nnbbeesstt--eerrrroorr,  and  --llaattttiiccee--eerrrroorr  options.  Addi-
              tionally, in --uussee--mmeesshh mode,  the  reference  words
              are  recorded  in  the  word mesh and can be output
              with --wwrriittee, indicating which word in  each  align-
              ment position is the correct one.

       --rreeffss _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s
              Read  a  table  of  reference transcripts from file
              _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e, for when multiple N-best lists are  pro-
              cessed (see --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess).  Each line in _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s
              must contain the sentence ID (the last component in
              the  N-best filename path, minus any suffixes) fol-
              lowed by zero or more reference words.

       The following options only affect lattice mode.

       --rreeaadd _f_i_l_e
              Reads an initial lattice from _f_i_l_e,  to  be  merged
              with  additional  paths constructed from the N-best
              hypotheses.

       --wwrriittee _f_i_l_e
              Writes the resulting word posterior lattice or mesh
              to _f_i_l_e, in wwllaatt--ffoorrmmaatt(5).

       --wwrriittee--ddiirr _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Write  the  resulting N-best lattices to _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y,
              in files named after the input  N-best  lists,  for
              when  multiple  N-best  lists  are  processed  (see
              --nnbbeesstt--ffiilleess).

       --pprriimmee--llaattttiiccee
              Start building the lattice with the best hypothesis
              obtained from N-best error minimization.  This pro-
              duces  slightly  better  alignments  and  sometimes
              lower  error  rates.   The default is to start with
              the top-scoring hypothesis.

       --pprriimmee--wwiitthh--11bbeesstt
              Similar to --pprriimmee--llaattttiiccee, but uses the  top-ranked
              sentence hypothesis for priming.  (Experience shows
              that   --nnoo--rreeoorrddeerr   --pprriimmee--llaattttiiccee   gives    best
              results.)

       --nnoo--mmeerrggee
              Build  a lattice from the N-best hypotheses without
              merging  edges  (string/lattice  alignment).   This
              creates  a  lattice  with  one  disjoint  path  per
              hypothesis, and is useful mainly for debugging pur-
              poses.

       --llaattttiiccee--eerrrroorr
              Compute  the  lattice error (minimum word error) of
              the lattice read with --rreeaadd or built with --nnbbeesstt.

       --ddiiccttiioonnaarryy file
              Use word pronunciations listed in _f_i_l_e to construct
              word  alignments  when  building word meshes.  This
              will use an alignment cost function  that  reflects
              the  number of inserted/deleted/substituted phones,
              rather than words.  The dictionary _f_i_l_e should con-
              tain one pronunciation per line, each naming a word
              in the first field, followed by a string  of  phone
              symbols.

       --rreeccoorrdd--hhyyppss
              Record  the  ranks of the hyps contributing to each
              word hypothesis in the resulting word lattice;  the
              information is included in --wwrriittee output.

       Several functions are not uniformly  implemented  for  all
       rescoring  modes  (e.g.,  --ddiiccttiioonnaarryy,  --rreeccoorrdd--hhyyppss,  and
       --nnbbeesstt--bbaacckkttrraaccee are currently effective only in mesh-lat-
       tice mode).
