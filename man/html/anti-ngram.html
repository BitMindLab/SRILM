<H2> NAME </H2>
anti-ngram - count posterior-weighted N-grams in N-best lists
<H2> SYNOPSIS </H2>
<B> anti-ngram </B>
[<B>-help</B>]<B></B>
<I> option </I>
...
<H2> DESCRIPTION </H2>
<B> anti-ngram </B>
counts the N-grams in a set of N-best hypotheses lists.
The N-gram counts are weighted by the posterior probabilities of the
hypotheses they occur in.
Thus, 
<B> anti-ngram </B>
can be used to construct language models of word sequences
that are acoustically confusable with correct hypotheses.
The counts output should be processed with
<B> ngram-count -float-counts </B>
to estimate a language model.
<P>
Each filename argument can be an ASCII file, or a 
compressed file (name ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indicate
stdin/stdout.
<H2> OPTIONS </H2>
<DL>
<DT><B> -help </B>
<DD>
Print option summary.
<DT><B>-refs</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Read the reference transcripts from 
<I>file</I>.<I></I>
Each line should contain an utterance ID followed by the transcript words.
<DT><B>-nbest-files</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
List of N-best files.
The base components of filenames must correspond to the utterance IDs found
in the reference file.
<DT><B>-max-nbest</B><I> n</I><B></B>
<DD>
Limits the number of hypotheses read from each N-best list to the first
<I>n</I>.<I></I>
<DT><B>-order</B><I> n</I><B></B>
<DD>
Set the maximal order (length) of N-grams to count.
The default order is 3.
<DT><B>-lm</B><I> file</I><B></B>
<DD>
Reads an ARPA language model from 
<I> file </I>
and rescores the N-best lists with it prior to counting N-grams.
<DT><B>-rescore-lmw</B><I> lmw</I><B></B>
<DD>
Sets the language model weight used in combining the language model log
probabilities with acoustic log probabilities
(only relevant if separate scores are given in the N-best input).
<DT><B>-rescore-wtw</B><I> wtw</I><B></B>
<DD>
Sets the word transition weight used to weight the number of words relative to
the acoustic log probabilities
(only relevant if separate scores are given in the N-best input).
<DT><B>-posterior-scale</B><I> scale</I><B></B>
<DD>
Divide the total weighted log score by 
<I> scale </I>
when computing normalized posterior probabilities.
This controls the peakedness of the posterior distribution. 
The default value is whatever was chosen for 
<B>-rescore-lmw</B>,<B></B>
so that language model scores are scaled to have weight 1,
and acoustic scores have weight 1/<I>lmw</I>.
<DT><B> -all-ngrams </B>
<DD>
Causes even N-grams that occur in the reference string to be counted.
By default N-best N-grams that also occur in the corresponding reference 
are excluded.
<DT><B>-read-counts</B><I> countsfile</I><B></B>
<DD>
Read N-gram counts from a file.
Each line contains an N-gram of 
words, followed by an integer or fractional count, all separated by whitespace.
Repeated counts for the same N-gram are added.
N-grams from N-best lists are added to those read with this option.
<DT><B>-write-counts</B><I> countsfile</I><B></B>
<DD>
Writes total N-gram counts to
<I>countsfile</I>.<I></I>
The default is to write to stdout.
<DT><B> -sort </B>
<DD>
Output counts in lexicographic order, as required for
<A HREF="ngram-merge.html">ngram-merge(1)</A>.
<DT><B>-debug</B><I> level</I><B></B>
<DD>
Set debugging output level.
Level 0 means no debugging.
Debugging messages are written to stderr.
</DD>
