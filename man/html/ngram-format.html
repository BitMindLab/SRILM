<H2> DESCRIPTION </H2>
The so-called ARPA (or Doug Paul) format for N-gram backoff models
starts with a header, introduced by the keyword <B>\data\</B>,
listing the number of N-grams of each length.
Following that, N-grams are listed one per line, grouped into sections
by length, each section starting with the keyword <B>\</B><I>N</I><B>-gram:</B>,
where
<I> N </I>
is the length of the N-grams to follow.
Each N-gram line starts with the logarithm (base 10) of conditional probability 
<I> p </I>
of that N-gram, followed by the words
<I>w1</I>...<I>wN</I>
making up the N-gram.
These are optionally followed by the logarithm (base 10) of the
backoff weight for the N-gram.
The keyword <B>\end\</B>
concludes the model representation.
<P>
Backoff weights are required only for those N-grams
that form a prefix of longer N-grams in the model.
The highest-order N-grams in particular will not need backoff weights
(they would be useless).
<P>
Since log(0) (minus infinity) has no portable representation, such values
are mapped to a large negative number.
However, the designated dummy value (-99 in SRILM) is interpreted as log(0)
when read back from file into memory.
<P>
The correctness of the N-gram counts 
<I>n1</I>,<I></I>
<I>n2</I>,<I></I>
... in the header is not enforced by SRILM software when reading 
models (although a warning is printed when an inconsistency is encountered).
This allows easy textual insertion or deletion of parameters in a model file.
The proper format can be recovered by passsing the model through
the command
<BR>
	ngram -order <I>N</I> -lm <I>input</I> -write-lm <I>output</I>
<P>
Note that the format is self-delimiting, allowing multiple models to
be stored in one file, or to be surrounded by ancillary information.
Some extensions of N-gram models in SRILM store additional parameters 
after a basic N-gram section in the standard format.

<A HREF="ngram.html">ngram(1)</A>, <A HREF="ngram-count.html">ngram-count(1)</A>, <A HREF="lm-scripts.html">lm-scripts(1)</A>, <A HREF="pfsg-scripts.html">pfsg-scripts(1)</A>.
<H2> BUGS </H2>
The ARPA format does not allow N-grams that have only a backoff weight
associated with them, but no conditional probability.
This makes the format less general than would otherwise be useful
(e.g., to support pruned models, or ones containing a mix of words and
classes).  The
<A HREF="ngram-count.html">ngram-count(1)</A>
tool satisfies this constraint by inserting dummy probabilities where
necessary.
<P>
For simplicity, an N-gram model containing N-grams up to length
<I> N </I>
is referred to in the SRILM programs as an 
<I>N</I>-th<I></I>
order model, although techncally it represents a Markov model of 
order 
<I>N</I>-1.<I></I>
<H2> BUGS </H2>
There is no way to specify words with embedded whitespace.
<H2> AUTHOR </H2>
The ARPA backoff format was developed by Doug Paul at MIT Lincoln Labs
for research sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA).
