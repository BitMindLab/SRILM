.SH DESCRIPTION
The so-called ARPA (or Doug Paul) format for N-gram backoff models
starts with a header, introduced by the keyword \fB\\data\\\fP,
listing the number of N-grams of each length.
Following that, N-grams are listed one per line, grouped into sections
by length, each section starting with the keyword \fB\\\fP\fIN\fP\fB-gram:\fP,
where
.I N
is the length of the N-grams to follow.
Each N-gram line starts with the logarithm (base 10) of conditional probability 
.I p
of that N-gram, followed by the words
.IR w1 ... wN
making up the N-gram.
These are optionally followed by the logarithm (base 10) of the
backoff weight for the N-gram.
The keyword \fB\\end\\\fP
concludes the model representation.
.PP
Backoff weights are required only for those N-grams
that form a prefix of longer N-grams in the model.
The highest-order N-grams in particular will not need backoff weights
(they would be useless).
.PP
Since log(0) (minus infinity) has no portable representation, such values
are mapped to a large negative number (typically -99).
.PP
The correctness of the N-gram counts 
.IR n1 ,
.IR n2 ,
\&... in the header is not enforced by SRILM software when reading 
models (although a warning is printed when an inconsistency is encountered).
This allows easy textual insertion or deletion of parameters in a model file.
The proper format can be recovered by passsing the model through
the command
.br
	ngram -order \fIN\fP -lm \fIinput\fP -write-lm \fIoutput\fP
.PP
Note that the format is self-delimiting, allowing multiple models to
be stored in one file, or to be surrounded by ancillary information.
Some extensions of N-gram models in SRILM store additional parameters 
after a basic N-gram section in the standard format.

ngram(1), ngram-count(1), lm-scripts(1), pfsg-scripts(1).
.SH BUGS
The ARPA format does not allow N-grams that have only a backoff weight
associated with them, but no conditional probability.
This makes the format less general than would otherwise be useful
(e.g., to support pruned models, or ones containing a mix of words and
classes).  The
.BR ngram-count (1)
tool satisfies this constraint by inserting dummy probabilities where
necessary.
.PP
For simplicity, an N-gram model containing N-grams up to length
.I N
is referred to in the SRILM programs as an 
.IR N -th
order model, although techncally it represents a Markov model of 
order 
.IR N -1.
.SH AUTHOR
The ARPA backoff format was developed by Doug Paul at MIT Lincoln Labs
for research sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA).
