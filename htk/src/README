This directory contains an interface between SRILM and the HTK lattice
tools developed at Entropic Cambridge Research Labs.  It will only be
of use if you have access to the HTK libraries and lattice tool source
files.

The following Makefile variables need to be changed to locate the
HTK-supplied files:

HTK_LIB_DIR
HTK_LATTICE_DIR

To use an SRILM model with HTK tools, the LM configuration files needs 
to start with "!SRILM".  Subsequent lines contain options and arguments
in the style of ngram(1).  See SRILM-config.sample for an example.
