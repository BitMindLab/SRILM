Here is a brief guide on how to build the SRI LM tools and associated
libraries.

1 - Unpack.  This should give a top-level directory with the subdirectories
    listed in README, as well as a few documentation files and a Makefile.

2 - Set the SRILM variable in the top-level Makefile to point to this
    top-level directory (an absolute path).

3 - You need a SunOS (Sparc or i386), IRIX 5.x, Alpha OSF, or Linux i686
    platform to compile out of the box.  For other OS/cpu combinations
    you will have to modify the bin/machine-type script to detect (and name)
    the platform type, and create a file common/Makefile.machine.<platform>
    that defines platform-dependent makefile variables.

4 - You need the following free third-party software to build SRILM:

	- gcc version 2.8.1 or higher
	  (including the C++ compiler and corresponding libg++ library).
	- GNU make 
	- John Ousterhout's Tcl toolkit, version 7.3 or higher
	  (this is currently used for some test programs, but is needed for
	  the build to go through without manual invention).

    The following tools are needed at runtime only:

	- gzip, to read/write compressed files)
	- GNU awk (gawk), to interpret many of the utility scripts

    Links to these packages can be found on the SRILM download page
    (http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/download.html).

5 - In the top-level directory, run

	gnumake World

    This will create the directories

	bin/
	lib/
	include/

    build everything and install public commands, libraries and headers in
    these directories.  Binaries are actually installed in subdirectories
    indicating the platform type.

    Some of the makefiles (*/src/Makefile) contain references to the Tcl
    library, and -I and -L flags may need to be adjusted if these are
    installed in non-standard places (other than /usr/local/lib and 
    /usr/local/include).

6 - The result of the above should be a fair number of .h and .cc files in
    include/, libraries in lib/$(MACHINE_TYPE), and programs in 
    bin/$(MACHINE_TYPE).

7 - Be sure to let me know if I left something out.
